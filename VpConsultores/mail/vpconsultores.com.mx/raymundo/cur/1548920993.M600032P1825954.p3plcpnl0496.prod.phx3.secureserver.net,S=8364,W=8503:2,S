Dear: Unpaid Beneficiary,

This is to inform you that in the course of my investigation as director of=
 payment verification / implementation committee I came across  your name a=
s unpaid fund beneficiary in the record of the central bank of Nigeria and =
other banks that are suppose to get your funds   released to you. My commit=
tee was set up by the payment reconciliation committee to verify and scruti=
nize all outstanding debts owed to   our foreign beneficiaries in accordanc=
e to the information received from the United States government and other c=
ountries over unpaid =20
huge debts owed to Foreigners.

Having seen your file and my further questioning to the officials of the ce=
ntral of Nigeria bank and ministry of finance as to why your   payment is s=
till pending reveals the rot and corruption in the system. The bank officia=
ls told me that the reason why you haven't   received your payment is due t=
o your inability to pay for the required charges for transfer of funds to y=
our account. When I asked them   why they didn't deduct the said charges fr=
om your principal sum, I was given the flimsy excuse that you never authori=
zed them to do so.  When I put the question across to them if they ever adv=
ised you that such charges could be deducted from your principal fund,the a=
nswer I  got was no. Now, if you do not tell this beneficiary that such cha=
rges could be deducted from his or her principal fund, how will he or   she=
 know that such options are available for such beneficiaries. From my inves=
tigation I discovered that these bank officials  deliberately refused to le=
t the charges be deducted from your principal fund  because they want your =
fund to remain trapped in the bank,=20

while they continue to extort money from beneficiaries under some flimsy  e=
xcuse. You do not need to pay any money to any official, all  you are requi=
red to do is swear to an affidavit at the federal high court  of Nigeria, a=
uthorizing the bank to deduct all charges from  your principal fund and tra=
nsfer the balance of funds after deduction to your  bank account. If you ha=
ve spent any money in the past in your quest for payment, kindly let me kno=
w so that I can follow this up. You can   reach me on my phone or email for=
 directive on how you can get the deduction done as soon as possible and ge=
t your payment also.

Yours sincerely,

Barr. Abubakar Malami (SAN)
